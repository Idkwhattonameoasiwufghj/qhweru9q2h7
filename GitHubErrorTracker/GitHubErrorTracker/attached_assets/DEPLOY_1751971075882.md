# Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Garden Trade Hub application to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Node.js 20+ installed

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
2. Name it `garden-trade-hub` (or your preferred name)
3. Make sure it's public (required for GitHub Pages)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository

```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Garden Trade Hub application"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/garden-trade-hub.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. The workflow will automatically trigger on push to main branch

## Step 4: Configure Base URL (if needed)

If your repository name is different from `garden-trade-hub`, update the `base` setting in `vite.config.production.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ... other config
  base: '/your-repository-name/',
  // ... rest of config
});
```

## Step 5: Deploy

The deployment will happen automatically when you push to the main branch. You can also manually trigger it:

1. Go to "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button

## Step 6: Access Your Deployed Site

Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/garden-trade-hub/`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check the Actions tab for error details
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Verify that the build works locally with `npm run build`

### Page Not Loading
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the base URL is correct in `vite.config.production.ts`
- Check that the `_redirects` file is properly created

### Discord Bot Integration
- For full Discord bot functionality, you'll need to:
  1. Create a Discord bot application
  2. Set up a backend server (not included in GitHub Pages)
  3. Use webhook or WebSocket connections for real-time updates

## Notes

- GitHub Pages only serves static files, so the Discord bot integration shown is a demo
- For full functionality, you'll need to deploy the backend to a service like Heroku, Vercel, or Railway
- The current setup uses in-memory storage which resets on each build
- For production, consider using a proper database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB

## Local Development

To run locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`
