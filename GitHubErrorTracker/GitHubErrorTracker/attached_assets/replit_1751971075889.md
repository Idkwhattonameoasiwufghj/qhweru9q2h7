# Garden Trade Hub

## Overview

Garden Trade Hub is a full-stack web application that facilitates plant and garden supply trading through a Discord-integrated platform. The application allows users to create, browse, and manage trade listings for plants, seeds, tools, and other garden-related items. It features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, designed to work seamlessly with Discord bot integration.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite bundler
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom garden-themed color palette
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state management

### Backend Architecture
- **Express Server**: RESTful API with middleware for logging and error handling
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Storage Interface**: Abstract storage layer with in-memory implementation for development
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for trades and user management

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Discord user information with display names and locations
- **Trades Table**: Trade listings with offering/seeking items, descriptions, categories, and status
- **Relationships**: Foreign key relationship between trades and users

### UI Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Garden-themed with forest green, sage, earth tones
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with consistent spacing
- **Components**: Reusable UI components following atomic design principles
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-based layouts

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Discord OAuth integration (simulated with hardcoded user IDs)
2. **Trade Creation**: Users create trades through web interface or Discord bot
3. **Trade Browsing**: Real-time filtering and sorting of trade listings
4. **Trade Management**: Status updates and user interaction tracking
5. **API Communication**: JSON-based REST API with error handling

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL connection for Neon database
- **drizzle-orm**: TypeScript ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI components
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **zod**: Schema validation

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production

## Deployment Strategy

The application supports multiple deployment environments:

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- **Frontend-only**: Static site deployment via GitHub Actions
- **Build Process**: Vite builds to `dist/public` with GitHub Pages configuration
- **Base URL**: Configurable for repository-specific paths
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment on push to main branch
- **Demo Mode**: Uses in-memory storage for demonstration

### Local Development
- **Development Mode**: Vite dev server with hot reloading
- **Full-stack**: Express backend with in-memory storage
- **Database**: In-memory storage for development

### Production Deployment (Full-stack)
- **Frontend**: Vite build to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundle to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle migrations in `/migrations`
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration switching

### Build Process
1. `npm run build`: Builds both frontend and backend
2. `npm run start`: Runs production server
3. `npm run dev`: Starts development server with hot reload
4. `npm run db:push`: Pushes database schema changes
5. `node deploy.js`: Prepares static build for GitHub Pages
